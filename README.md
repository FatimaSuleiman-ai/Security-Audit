what it does and why it matters.
The rik assessment conducted on botium toy reveals that botium toy should prioritize the following immediate actions:
1.	Establish access control measures (Least Privilege, Separation of Duties).
2.	Implement a comprehensive disaster recovery and backup strategy.
3.	Enforce strong password policies and use a password management system.
4.	Install and properly manage firewalls and intrusion detection systems.
